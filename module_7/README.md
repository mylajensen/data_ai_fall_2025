# Module 7: Choose Your Adventure 

This week is "Choose Your Adventure" week where you go deeper on a topic of your choice - this could be:

* Excel or Google Sheets
* SQL
* BI tooling (see the PowerBI file in this folder - PC is required)
* Data Storytelling
* AI Tooling - build a data visualization using lovable.dev, bolt.new, claude.ai etc
* or even trying your hand at Python or R if you are interested! 

Using our class format  - find a series of video lessons and watch and complete them. Then choose a data set and analyze it in your preferred tool, leveraging the video lesson you watched to complete the assignment. 

Goal = Spend 10 hours on the topic of your choice. 

# Video Lessons: 

- [x] Curate the videos you watched for your topic of choice and add here under "Video Lessons".
- [x] Data Analyst Bootcamp - This video helped me refresh my memory on the different platforms we learned. 
Tableau Full Course - This was a great video to see tableau explained by someone else and she was even able to share how to create data visuals in tableau. I loved being able to see how she explained the features and capacities this platform has. 
Tableau Tutorial - I used this video to see how others teach Tableau and see the kind of shortcuts others use. It’s amazing to see the features that people go to right away and how they navigate the platform differently than others. Same goal of data visuals but different ways to get there.  
Build a dashboard - This is the video that I used to build my dashboard 
- [x] Ideas for videos could be Alex the Analyst videos on advanced Excel topics, intermediate SQL, or intro to Python from his [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSNXoAs2FtQ) series.
